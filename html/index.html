      <h2>Over three thousand years before the rise of Darth Vader...</h2>
        <p>Protected by the legendary Jedi Order, the Galactic Republic stood as a bastion of peace in the galaxy for a thousand generations. Several 
        centuries ago, the greatest threat the galaxy has ever known emerged in the form of the dark Sith Empire. After a volatile war, the Republic 
        emerged victorious and the Sith were assumed to be extinct. Nonetheless, the Jedi have maintained a constant vigil over the ancient Sith 
        homeworld, Korriban, to protect the galaxy from the darkness that still resides in the planet's tombs.</p>
        <p>Though a small group of survivors escaped to warn of the Imperial invasion, it was only a minor reprieve for the Republic. Korriban was one 
        of several worlds to fall in the initial onslaught, and in the years that followed, the Republic suffered many more painful defeats. Emboldened 
        by their numerous victories, the Empire soon moved to conquer the Core Worlds, luring the Republic fleet out of position and launching a 
        surprise attack against the noble world of Alderaan.</p>
        <p>The courageous stand on Alderaan rallied the spirits of Republic defenders across the galaxy, but the balance of the power remained in the 
        Empire's favor. This only fueled the surprise felt when the Imperial Dark Council extended the offer to the Republic to engage in peace 
        negotiations. Suspecting possible treachery, Republic officials agreed to meet on Alderaan, but insisted that the Jedi Order marshal all 
        its resources to provide comprehensive security. The Jedi complied, sending most senior members of the Order to Alderaan, and leaving only 
        a token force in the Temple on Coruscant...</p>
        <p>After destroying the Jedi Temple and overwhelming the Republic's defenses, Imperial forces occupied Coruscant, holding the planet hostage 
        while negotiations restarted on Alderaan. With their capital at stake, Republic officials had little choice but to agree to the Empire's terms.</p>
        <p>The Treaty of Coruscant was signed, forcing the Republic to cede control of several star systems and to acknowledge new boundaries of Imperial 
        dominion. Though the treaty brought about an official end to the war, tensions between the two sides have remained high over the last several 
        years, and now, a return to open war seems all but inevitable...</p>
